This is a project I have built to showcase my NextJs/React skill, in creating a store that communicates with a backend to fetch the products, categories, images etc. The store is designed using the mobile first approach.

**Why NextJS**

With NextJs we can optimize the site for better SEO and potentially better performance with revalidation strategies. That way the customer can have fast shopping experience.
